I am making this as a learning experience for myself, to see if I can learn and implement what I need to make this a functional react/redux application.

An early thank you to all who will have helped me out!

## Pages

1. Time Tracking

> The app provides the ability to record current week activities. You will be able to add pre-defined projects to your list and enter how many hours were spent on that particular day during any given day of that week.

2. Time Forecasting

> The user will be able to charge forecasted hours in this menu for the next 8 weeks.

3. Project tracking

> The user will input projects that will be recorded in the time forecasting and time tracking components.

4. Analysis

> The user will be provided a simple bar graph representing hours charged in the different project type classifications for the past 8 weeks, current week and future 8 weeks.

## Project Development plan

1. Logical Design of Data Model
2. Separate out component pieces based on page Diagrams
3. Recognize state hierarchy
4. List components out, and what each component requires in dependencies
